Built with **HTML/CSS/JS**, powered by **local JSON + sprites**, and completely offline once set up.

## üöÄ Running the App

This is a **static site** (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON). To run it locally:

```bash
cd po-go-battle-assistant
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open:

üëâ http://localhost:8000/index.html

> üí° Tip: Voice input depends on the browser‚Äôs Web Speech API. Use the hosted version in Chrome or Edge for microphone support; locally served builds fall back to text search.

## üß± Repository Overview

- `index.html`, `sprites/`, `data/` ‚Äî the offline web app.
- `scripts/` ‚Äî helper utilities for rebuilding the dataset and sprite library.
- `make_icon.py` and `icon.png` ‚Äî tooling/assets for the desktop Electron wrapper.
- `demoPNG.png`, `demo-gif.gif` ‚Äî promotional screenshots used in the README.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

All tooling is Python-based and works with Python 3.9+ (no external dependencies required).

### Refreshing the Pok√©mon dataset

The app reads from `data/pokemon.min.json`. To refresh the data (all Pok√©mon, forms, and available moves straight from the latest Game Master), run:

```bash
python scripts/build_pokemon_json.py
```

The script downloads the current Game Master from the PokeMiners project, expands every form (regional, costume, mega, shadow, etc.), and writes a compact JSON file ready for offline use. You can also point it at a local Game Master dump:

```bash
python scripts/build_pokemon_json.py ~/Downloads/latest.json data/pokemon.min.json
```

### Updating sprites

To refresh the bundled artwork, clone [`PokeAPI/sprites`](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites) and run:

```bash
python scripts/collect_sprites.py /path/to/PokeAPI/sprites ./sprites
```

The helper copies both the high-resolution official artwork and fallback front sprites into the `sprites/` directory, renaming them to match the Pok√©dex numbering used by the app.
